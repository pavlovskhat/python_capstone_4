# Python Capstone Project 4
###### Added more functionality to the task manager program from
capstone project 3.

## Added the following functions to the program
1. Enhanced the program flow by converting main functions to methods.
2. Added methods to any repetitive program actions.
3. Created databases within the program with the user of dictionaries.
4. Users are now able to generate reports based tasks or user.
5. Admin has added information on his statistics view.

## Reporting additional information
1. When generating a report the information is written to 'task_overview'
and 'user_overview'.
2. If no reports are generated when admin wants to view it a report is
generated first.
3. Note that these reports are built with a number of dictionaries to recall
specific indices and indexes according to which data is required.
